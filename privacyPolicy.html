            </p>

            <h3 class="sectionSubTitle"> What information do We collect? And how do We use it? </h3>
            <p>
              Meem collects different types of information from you as a user, such as your username, email
              address, how frequently you are are online, App performance logs. This information is used by

              improve and customize our services. Other information is collected to be able to communicate
              with you. Information may also be collected to ensure your security.

            </p>
            <p>
              To be more specific, Meem gathers information that falls under one of the following categories:
            </p>

        </div>

        <div class="row" id="faq">
          <div class="col-md-10 mx-auto text-left" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">

                  <p>
                    This includes information that you, as a user, directly input into the App. This can occur in
                    different situations:
                  </p>
                  <h5> (A) when you sign up </h5>
                  <p>
                    Meem requires a number of details from you when you sign up, in particular: your
                    first name, last name, gender, date of birth, username and email address.
                    Meem collects the above information to create users’ accounts, and to
                    consequently, authenticate such accounts when necessary. Email addresses may
                    also be used to inform you of any updates to our Terms of Service and/or Privacy
                    Policy, security alerts, launch of new features, and any other events that may be of
                    interest to you.

                  <h5> (B) when you use our Services </h5>
                  <p>
                    Once you have signed up, you are able to customize your profile through the use
                    of display pictures and bio. Meem may collect this information as it helps it
                    understand its users and, in time, enhance their individual experiences and
                    suggest relevant content.
                    Additionally, when you begin to use our Services, We may collect different types
                    of information that you would input.
                    For example, when engaging with other users in public conversations, such public
                    messages may be collected to detect trends and allow Us to build a better
                    experience for our users.
                    As for direct messages, to protect the privacy of our users, Meem uses RSA and
                    AES technologies to ensure that nobody except the user has access to his/her
                    direct messages. Any direct message that you send to our servers remains there
                    in encrypted form and cannot be viewed by anybody including Meem.

                    To allow Us to provide our Services and continuously improve them, We work with
                    Firebase, a Google cloud platform, as our backend server. From the variety of services
                    that Firebase offers, Meem uses the following features:
                    <br><br>
                    Google Analytics for Firebase, Firebase Realtime Database, Firebase Hosting, Cloud
                    Functions for Firebase (Beta), Cloud Firestore (Beta), Cloud Storage for Firebase, Firebase
                    Authentication, Firebase Test Lab, Firebase Crash Reporting, Firebase Performance
                    Monitoring, Firebase Cloud Messaging, Firebase Dynamic Links, Firebase Remote
                    Config, Firebase A/B Testing (Beta), Firebase Predictions (Beta), ML Kit for Firebase (beta),
                    FireBase App Indexing, Crashlytics.
                    <br><br>
                    Some of the above features may collect and process different types of information
                    relating to the users of our Services. However, none of the above features processes
                    personally identifying information, such as full name, email addresses or passwords.
                    Additionally, Meem does not combine any personally identifying information that it may
                    have independently collected with the information collected through the use of Firebase.
                    <br><br>
                    At the heart of Firebase is Google Analytics for Firebase, an analytics solution that
                    integrates across Firebase’s other features. In using Google Analytics for Firebase, We
                    particularly implement the following features: Analytics intelligence, reporting, data
                    analysis and visualization, data collection and management, Data activation. [
                    <br><br>
                    Google’s collection or processing of information on our Services is restricted by the
                    Firebase terms of service that can be found on/at https://firebase.google.com/terms and
                    Google’s privacy policy located at http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/. For more
                    specific information about how Google uses information from sites and apps that use its
                    services, you may also see https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites.

                    <br><br>
                    You can opt-out of the Google Analytics for Firebase features We use, by taking the
                    following steps in the App: Settings > Privacy > Disable Google Analytics.
                    <br><br>
                    Meem may also use other third-party service providers in the future to monitor and
                    analyze the use of its Services.
